Data Structures and Algorithm II - C950 

Parcel Delivery Program
LANGUAGE: Python
IDE: Pycharm CE

SCENARIO : 
For this assessment, I was asked to implement an algorithm to route delivery trucks
that will allow you to meet all delivery constraints while traveling under 140 miles. 
The program starts with 40 parcels that must be delivered around the Salt Lake City area 
by a specified deadline. Parcels have constraints or delays that must be accounted for 
before they can be successfully delivered. The program also contains a simple user interface 
that allows users to view all parcels at a specific time or view a single parcel by its unique id number.

HOW TO USE PROGRAM:
When the program is launched, the user will be greeted by the home menu. The home menu contains three navigation
options 1, 2, and 3. By enter the number 1, the user can view information about a specific parcel by entering the
parcels unique ID number. 
If the user enters the number 2, the user will receive a prompt to enter a specific time to view
the ID, departure time and status of all parcels at the entered time.
If the user enters the number 3, the program will simply terminate.
